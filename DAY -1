LAB2 - RISC-V GCC COMPILE AND DISASSEMBLE

#riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1  -mabi=lp64  march=rv64i  -o sum1ton.o  sum1ton.c 

the above command is used in Ubuntu to compile a C source code file (sum1ton.c) into an object file (sum1ton.o) using the RISC-V 64-bit architecture toolchain (riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc)

O1 - optimisation flag GCC will try to optimize the code for size and execution speed.

-mabi=lp64: This flag specifies the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to use. ABI defines how functions, data, and system calls are represented and accessed in machine code. lp64 stands for "Long, Pointer, 64-bit," which means that integers and longs are 64 bits, and pointers are also 64 bits.

-march=rv64i: This flag specifies the target RISC-V architecture. 

So, when you run this command in Ubuntu, it will take the sum1ton.c source code, compile it with the specified options and toolchain, and produce an object file named sum1ton.o that can later be linked to create an executable program for the RISC-V 64-bit architecture.

When you run ls -ltr in a terminal in Ubuntu, you'll see a list of files and directories in the current directory
